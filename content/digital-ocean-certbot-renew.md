Since I started learning to use [Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io) for work,
I've hosted this site and a couple of others on a small cluster on
[DigitalOcean](https://digitalocean.com). While I've typically hosted my sites
on [Linode](https://linode.com), DigitalOcean has built in some decent support
for casual users like myself, such as charging only for workers, and automatic
setup of load balancers. Since DigitalOcean charges for load balancers, I host
my Vexing Workshop projects as subdomains under a single wildcard certificate to
help keep costs down.

DigitalOcean's tools for requesting and managing [Let's Encrypt](https://letsencrypt.org)
are good, but for a setting such as mine, you'll have to manage retrieving,
installing and updating your certificates yourself. When I first set up this
site, I referred to Anchorite's wonderfully direct article:

[Creating a Wildcard SSL Certificate for a DigitalOcean Droplet](https://www.stauber.org/index.php/2018/12/02/creating-a-wildcard-ssl-certificate-for-a-digitalocean-droplet/)

Following the instructions in this article, I installed `certbot`, Let's
Encrypt's official client, and requested a wildcard certificate using DNS to
authenticate my request. By the time I was done I'd generated my certificates
locally and was able to install them into my DigitalOcean account via the web
console.

## What did I try first?

When I first sat down to update my certificate, I tried to simply run `certbot
renew`, hoping that would be it. Instead, I got this gnarly error:

```shell
Attempting to renew cert (vexingworkshop.com) from /etc/letsencrypt/renewal/vexingworkshop.com.conf produced an unexpected error: The manual plugin is not working; there may be problems with your existing configuration.
The error was: PluginError('An authentication script must be provided with --manual-auth-hook when using the manual plugin non-interactively.'). Skipping.
All renewal attempts failed. The following certs could not be renewed:
  /etc/letsencrypt/live/vexingworkshop.com/fullchain.pem (failure)
```

As I dug through the [`certbot` documentation](https://certbot.eff.org/docs/), I
found that the `renew` command was not compatible with the interactive process
described in the article above. I was going to have to write some scripts to
be called as hooks through the upgrade process that would setup the necessary
DNS records, perform the deploy, then clean up after. As I was getting started
writing these scripts, I discovered that there are [plugins available](https://certbot.eff.org/docs/using.html#id15) for my cloud provider and others, that could help me with this task!


## Let's set up some tools

Going forward, I'm going to assume you've followed Anchorite's instructions, or
that you have at least installed `certbot` and that your previously created
certificates are getting ready to expire.

Since I'm hosting my cluster on DigitalOcean, I chose the
[`certbot-dns-digitalocean`](https://certbot-dns-digitalocean.readthedocs.io/en/stable/)
plugin. While your distribution may have a package for this plugin, I'm on macOS
and `homebrew` _does not._ I did, however, find that all of the DNS plugins may
be found on `pip`. You may need to adjust the instructions below for your
particular system.

So, let's first start by creating a Python 3 virtual environment and activate
it.

```shell
$ python3 -mvenv ~/env/digitalocean
$ . ~/env/digitalocean/bin/activate
```

Now we'll install our plugin.

```shell
$ pip install certbot-dns-digitalocean
```

After a few minutes of downloading dependencies, your plugin has been installed.
You can verify this by listing installed packages _(output edited for brevity)_.

```shell
$ pip list

Package                  Version 
------------------------ --------
...
certbot                  0.35.1  
certbot-dns-digitalocean 0.35.1  
...
```

## If you want to keep a secret...

In order for `certbot` to authenticate against the DigitalOcean API, you're
going to need to generate an API key. If you already have a generated key and
you know where it is, skip this step. Otherwise, in the DigitalOcean web
console, navigate to __API__ screen which, at the time of this writing, opens to
the __Tokens/Keys__ section. Click on the __Generate New Token__ and follow the
instructions. Be sure to select both _read_ and _write_ options. Copy the key
when it is presented to you, the value will not be shown to you again.

The `certbot` client and our plugin will require our token to be stored in an
INI file. I've opted to store mine in a hidden directory in my $HOME, thus:

```shell
$ mkdir -p ~/.secrets/certbot/
$ touch ~/.secrets/certbot/digitalocean.ini
$ chmod 600 ~/.secrets/certbot/digitalocean.ini
```

And the contents of the file should look like this, with your token in its
place:

```config
dns_digitalocean_token = <my secret token>
```

Tools installed, token acquired, we're ready to proceed!

## Update, Upload, Verify

The `certbot-dns-digitalocean` plugin will do the greatest part of the work from
here on in. All we have to do now is to issue the renew command as I tried
before, but with a bit more information.

```shell
$ sudo certbot renew --dns-digitalocean \
    --dns-digitalocean-credentials ~/.secrets/certbot/digitalocean.ini

With any luck, and if you followed instructions carefully, you should see output
like above, and you now have updated certificates on your local machine. Now we
have to get them to DigitalOcean where they'll be useful. This time, I've opted
to upload my certificate via the web UI, but you could certainly use
DigitalOcean's REST API to perform the same steps. Next time I update my
certificate I plan to do exactly that, and I'll update the site with my
findings.

In the web UI, under __Account__, navigate to __Security__. On this page you
will find, under a __Certificates__ heading, any certificates you've uploaded,
likely including your soon-to-expire certificate. Since I'm not aware of a way
to update a certificate in place, I chose to add my updated certificate along
side the existing one. Click __Add Certificate__, and in the dialog now choose
__Bring your own certificate__. Fill out the form, giving your certificate a
unque name.

The information you need to fill out the rest of the form should be found under
`/etc/letsencrypt/live/<your domain.com>/`. Copy the contents of `cert.pem` to
the field labeled __Certificate__; copy the contents of `privkey.pem` to the
field labeled __Private key__; then copy the contents of `chain.pem` to the
field labeled __Certificate chain__. Click __Save SSL Certificate__.

Now all you have to do is update the appropriate forwarding rules for your load
balancer, however you've got it set up. As this can vary a bit between
configurations, I'll leave this part to you.

Äœis la revido!
