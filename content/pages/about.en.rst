About
#####

My name is Adam. I am an aging engineer, tinker, hippy and anarchist. I love
science fiction novels, doom metal, board games and motorcycles.

I've been working on the web since the late nineties. I miss the internet I
believed we were building back then, I liked it when Linux was hard, and get of
my lawn. Our greed led us to build a techno-dystopia instead of the utopia we
owe ourselves, but I'm not convinced that fight is over yet.

I don't waste much time on belief, and I have no patience for -isms. That being
said, "Every man and every woman is a star." I do believe in the individual's
inherent right to freedom, but Don't Tread On Me is utter bullshit. If you're
free and I'm free, stuff is complicated and we have to work together.

I'm a hacker but I like making things more than I like breaking things. I like
starting projects more than I like finishing them, but I also love convincing
others to finish what I've started.

This is a place for me to get some things out, to share things I've tinkered
with and maybe where I can learn some new things. Cheers.
